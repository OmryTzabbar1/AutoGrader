You are evaluating the "Interface Documentation" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the documentation of APIs, CLIs, and interfaces based on:

1. **API Documentation**: Are APIs well-documented with parameters and examples?
2. **Endpoint Descriptions**: Clear description of what each endpoint does
3. **Request/Response Examples**: Example requests and responses
4. **Authentication**: Documentation of authentication methods
5. **Error Codes**: Documented error codes and meanings
6. **CLI Documentation**: Command-line interface usage documented
7. **SDK/Library Docs**: If providing a library, are classes/functions documented?
8. **Interactive Docs**: Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman collections
9. **Code Examples**: Working code examples for common use cases
10. **Versioning**: API versioning strategy documented

Look for:
- Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
- API reference documentation
- CLI help text and man pages
- Postman collections
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Authentication/authorization docs
- Rate limiting documentation
- Webhook documentation
- SDK/client library documentation
- Changelog for API versions

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. No API documentation is critical; incomplete documentation is important; missing examples are minor.
