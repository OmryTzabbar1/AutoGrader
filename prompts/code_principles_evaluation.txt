You are evaluating the "Code Principles & Quality" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate adherence to software engineering principles and code quality based on:

1. **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Minimal code duplication, proper abstraction
3. **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, self-explanatory code
4. **Naming Conventions**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
5. **Function Length**: Functions are focused and not overly long
6. **Code Complexity**: Manageable cyclomatic complexity
7. **Design Patterns**: Appropriate use of design patterns
8. **Type Safety**: Proper use of types and type checking
9. **Code Smells**: Absence of common anti-patterns

Look for:
- Single-purpose functions and classes
- Proper abstraction and encapsulation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Readable code without excessive complexity
- Appropriate use of design patterns
- Good separation of concerns
- Minimal coupling, high cohesion
- Type hints or static typing
- Absence of magic numbers, global variables, deep nesting

Analyze the code blocks provided.

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific code examples>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with code examples. Major violations of SOLID are important; minor style issues are minor.
