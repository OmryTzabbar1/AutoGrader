You are evaluating the "Git Practices & Version Control" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate version control practices based on:

1. **Commit Quality**: Clear, descriptive commit messages
2. **Commit Frequency**: Regular commits throughout development
3. **Commit Size**: Atomic commits with focused changes
4. **Branching Strategy**: Use of branches for features/fixes
5. **Git History**: Clean, logical git history
6. **Merge Commits**: Proper merge practices (no massive merges)
7. **.gitignore**: Proper gitignore excluding build artifacts
8. **Tags**: Use of tags for releases/versions
9. **Pull Requests**: Use of PRs with code review (if applicable)
10. **Conventional Commits**: Following commit message conventions

Look for:
- Descriptive commit messages ("Fix user authentication bug" not "fix")
- Regular commit history (not just 1-2 commits)
- Feature branches (feature/*, bugfix/*)
- Meaningful .gitignore file
- No committed secrets, build artifacts, or IDE files
- Semantic versioning tags (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
- PR descriptions and review comments
- Conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- No force pushes to main
- Clean merge history

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. Committed secrets is critical; poor commit messages are important; minor git hygiene issues are minor.
