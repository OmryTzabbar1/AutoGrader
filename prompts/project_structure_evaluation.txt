You are evaluating the "Project Structure" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the project organization and file structure based on the following aspects:

1. **Logical Organization**: Are files and directories organized logically?
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Is code properly separated (src, tests, docs, config)?
3. **Naming Conventions**: Are file and directory names clear and consistent?
4. **Standard Structure**: Does it follow language/framework conventions?
5. **Modularity**: Is the code organized into reusable modules/packages?
6. **Build System**: Is there a proper build/package configuration (setup.py, package.json, pom.xml)?
7. **Resource Management**: Are resources (data, assets, configs) properly organized?
8. **Documentation Structure**: Is documentation well-organized?

Look for:
- Clear directory hierarchy (src/, tests/, docs/, config/, data/)
- Source code organization (packages, modules)
- Test directory structure mirroring source
- Configuration files in appropriate locations
- Build/packaging files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Documentation organization
- Data and asset directories
- Absence of clutter (no build artifacts, IDE files in repo)

Evaluate based on code references and any project structure descriptions in the document.

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references from the document>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific and reference concrete examples. Poor organization is important; minor inconsistencies are minor issues.
