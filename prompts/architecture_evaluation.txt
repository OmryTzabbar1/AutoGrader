You are evaluating the "Architecture Documentation" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the system architecture documentation based on the following aspects:

1. **System Overview**: Is there a clear high-level description of the system architecture?
2. **Component Diagram**: Are system components and their relationships clearly illustrated?
3. **Design Patterns**: Are appropriate design patterns identified and justified?
4. **Technology Stack**: Is the technology stack clearly documented with rationale?
5. **Data Flow**: Is data flow between components clearly explained?
6. **Scalability Considerations**: Are scalability and performance considerations addressed?
7. **Design Decisions**: Are key architectural decisions documented with trade-offs?
8. **Interfaces**: Are APIs and interfaces between components well-defined?

Look for:
- Architecture diagrams (layered, component, deployment)
- Technology choices and justifications
- Design patterns (MVC, microservices, event-driven, etc.)
- Database schema and data model
- API specifications
- Security architecture
- Deployment architecture
- Trade-off analysis for design decisions

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references from the document>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific and reference concrete examples. Assign severity based on impact on system understanding and maintainability.
