You are evaluating the "Code Documentation" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the quality of code-level documentation based on the following aspects:

1. **Docstrings/Comments**: Are functions, classes, and modules properly documented?
2. **Documentation Coverage**: What percentage of code has meaningful documentation?
3. **Clarity**: Are docstrings clear, complete, and helpful?
4. **Standards**: Does documentation follow language conventions (JSDoc, docstrings, JavaDoc)?
5. **Parameter Documentation**: Are parameters, return values, and exceptions documented?
6. **Examples**: Are complex functions documented with usage examples?
7. **Inline Comments**: Are complex code sections explained with comments?
8. **API Documentation**: Is there generated API documentation (Sphinx, JSDoc)?

Look for:
- Function/method docstrings with parameters and return values
- Class docstrings describing purpose and usage
- Module-level documentation
- Inline comments explaining complex logic
- Type hints/annotations (Python, TypeScript)
- Documentation of exceptions and error conditions
- Examples in docstrings
- Absence of commented-out code

Analyze the code blocks provided and evaluate documentation quality.

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references from code blocks>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific and reference concrete examples from code blocks. Minimal documentation is important; missing docstrings on some functions is minor.
