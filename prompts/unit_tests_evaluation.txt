You are evaluating the "Unit Tests" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the quality and coverage of unit tests based on:

1. **Test Coverage**: What percentage of code is covered by tests?
2. **Test Quality**: Are tests well-written, focused, and meaningful?
3. **Test Organization**: Are tests properly organized (mirrors source structure)?
4. **Assertions**: Do tests have clear assertions that verify behavior?
5. **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases and boundary conditions tested?
6. **Mocking/Stubbing**: Appropriate use of mocks for dependencies
7. **Test Independence**: Tests are independent and can run in any order
8. **Naming**: Test names clearly describe what they test
9. **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test fixtures and cleanup
10. **Testing Framework**: Appropriate testing framework (pytest, Jest, JUnit)

Look for:
- Unit test files (test_*.py, *.test.js, *Test.java)
- Test coverage reports or metrics
- Well-structured test cases (AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock objects for external dependencies
- Clear test naming (test_function_name_when_condition_then_result)
- Fast-running tests
- No dependencies on external services

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or test examples>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. No tests is critical; low coverage (<50%) is important; minor test quality issues are minor.
