You are evaluating the "Error Handling" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the error handling and robustness based on:

1. **Exception Handling**: Proper try-catch blocks for error-prone operations
2. **Error Types**: Using appropriate exception types/classes
3. **Error Messages**: Clear, informative error messages
4. **Logging**: Errors are logged appropriately
5. **Graceful Degradation**: System handles errors without crashing
6. **Input Validation**: Validates inputs before processing
7. **Recovery**: Appropriate error recovery mechanisms
8. **User Feedback**: Users receive helpful error feedback
9. **Testing**: Error paths are tested
10. **No Silent Failures**: Errors are not swallowed without handling

Look for:
- Try-catch blocks around I/O, network calls, file operations
- Custom exception classes
- Logging of exceptions with context
- Input validation before processing
- Appropriate error return codes or exceptions
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Circuit breakers for external services
- Error handling tests
- No bare except: or catch (Exception) without re-raising

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific code examples>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. No error handling is critical; inadequate handling is important; minor improvements are minor.
