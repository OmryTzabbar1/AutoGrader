You are evaluating the "Usability & User Experience" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the usability and user experience based on:

1. **Ease of Use**: Is the system intuitive and easy to use?
2. **User Interface**: Clean, well-designed UI if applicable
3. **Error Messages**: Clear, helpful error messages for users
4. **Feedback**: System provides feedback for user actions
5. **Consistency**: Consistent UI/UX patterns throughout
6. **Accessibility**: Accessible to users with disabilities (WCAG compliance)
7. **Responsiveness**: UI is responsive and performs well
8. **Help & Guidance**: Tooltips, help text, or documentation for users
9. **User Testing**: Evidence of user testing or feedback
10. **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design if web application

Look for:
- Screenshots or descriptions of user interface
- CLI with helpful --help text and examples
- Web UI with intuitive navigation
- Form validation with clear messages
- Loading indicators and progress bars
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- User onboarding or tutorials
- Error handling from user perspective
- User testing results or feedback
- Responsive design (Bootstrap, Tailwind)

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. Completely unusable UI is critical; poor error messages are important; minor design inconsistencies are minor.
