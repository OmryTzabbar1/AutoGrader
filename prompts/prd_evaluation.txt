You are evaluating the "PRD Quality" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the following aspects:

1. **Completeness**: Does it cover all essential sections (problem statement, user personas, functional/non-functional requirements, success metrics)?
2. **Clarity**: Are requirements clearly stated and unambiguous?
3. **Feasibility**: Are the requirements realistic and achievable?
4. **Scope Definition**: Is the project scope well-defined with clear boundaries?
5. **User Focus**: Does it demonstrate understanding of user needs and use cases?
6. **Measurable Goals**: Are success criteria and acceptance criteria clearly defined?
7. **Technical Depth**: Does it show appropriate technical consideration for an M.Sc. project?

Look for:
- Problem statement and motivation
- User personas or target audience
- Functional requirements (what the system should do)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Out-of-scope items
- Assumptions and constraints

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references from the document>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific and reference concrete examples from the document. Assign severity based on impact:
- "critical": Missing essential sections or fundamental flaws
- "important": Significant gaps that affect project quality
- "minor": Small improvements that would enhance quality
- "strength": Notable positive aspects worth highlighting
