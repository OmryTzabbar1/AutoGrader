You are evaluating the "Security Practices" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate security considerations and practices based on:

1. **Input Validation**: Proper validation and sanitization of user inputs
2. **Authentication/Authorization**: Secure authentication and access control if applicable
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data (at rest and in transit)
4. **Dependency Security**: No known vulnerable dependencies
5. **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys, passwords, tokens
6. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries, ORMs
7. **XSS Prevention**: Output encoding, CSP headers (if web app)
8. **Security Headers**: Appropriate security headers (HTTPS, CORS)
9. **Error Handling**: No sensitive info in error messages
10. **Security Testing**: Evidence of security considerations

Look for:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized SQL queries or ORMs
- Password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- HTTPS usage
- Secure session management
- CSRF protection (if web app)
- Rate limiting
- Security-related tests
- Dependency scanning
- .env files in .gitignore

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. Critical vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets) are critical; missing security headers are important.
