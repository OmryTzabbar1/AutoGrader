You are evaluating the "Visualization Quality" criterion for a Master's level Computer Science software project.

Evaluate the quality of data visualizations and charts based on:

1. **Appropriateness**: Are chart types appropriate for the data?
2. **Clarity**: Are visualizations clear and easy to understand?
3. **Labeling**: Proper axis labels, titles, and legends
4. **Design**: Good use of colors, fonts, and layout
5. **Information Density**: Right amount of information (not cluttered or sparse)
6. **Insights**: Visualizations effectively communicate insights
7. **Interactivity**: Interactive visualizations if applicable
8. **Accessibility**: Color-blind friendly palettes, readable fonts
9. **Professional Quality**: Publication-quality graphics
10. **Variety**: Appropriate variety of visualization types

Look for:
- Clear chart titles and axis labels
- Appropriate chart types (bar, line, scatter, heatmap, etc.)
- Color palettes (colorbrewer, viridis)
- Legends and annotations
- Grid lines and tick marks
- Interactive dashboards (Plotly, Dash, Streamlit)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, D3.js, ggplot visualizations
- Comparative visualizations
- Trend lines and statistical overlays
- Dashboard screenshots or embedded plots

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "score": <float between 0-100>,
    "evidence": [<list of specific quotes or references>],
    "strengths": [<list of identified strengths>],
    "weaknesses": [<list of identified weaknesses>],
    "suggestions": [<list of actionable improvement suggestions>],
    "severity": "<one of: critical, important, minor, strength>"
}

Be specific with examples. No visualizations for data-heavy projects is critical; poor labeling is important; minor design issues are minor.
